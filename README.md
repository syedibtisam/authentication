## Introduction

The authentication system is designed to manage user access and identity verification within a web application. It ensures that users can securely register, log in, and access protected routes while implementing best security practices.

## Features

- **User Registration**: Allows users to sign up with unique credentials.
- **User Login**: Authenticates users and generates secure authentication tokens.
- **Password Hashing**: Uses bcrypt for password encryption.
- **Session Management**: Implements session-based authentication using JWT (JSON Web Token).
- **Middleware for Authentication**: Protects specific routes and validates user sessions.
- **Environment Configuration**: Uses dotenv to manage sensitive configuration variables.
- **Error Handling**: Implements structured error responses for better debugging.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `config/`: Configuration files for database and environment settings.
- `controllers/`: Business logic for handling authentication operations.
- `middlewares/`: Middleware functions for authentication and request validation.
- `models/`: Database models and schemas for user management.
- `routes/`: API routes defining endpoints for authentication services.
- `.env`: Environment variables for configuration.
- `.gitignore`: Specifies files and directories to be ignored by Git.
- `app.js`: Entry point of the application.
- `package-lock.json`: Records the exact versions of dependencies installed.
- `package.json`: Lists dependencies and scripts for the application.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/syedibtisam/authentication.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:

   ```bash
   cd authentication
   ```

3. **Install the dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Set up environment variables**:

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the necessary environment variables as specified in the `config/` directory.

## Usage

To start the application, run:

```bash
node app.js
```

By default, the server will start on `http://localhost:3000`. You can configure the port and other settings in the `app.js` file.

## API Endpoints

The application provides the following API endpoints for user authentication:

- **POST `/register`**: Allows a new user to register by providing a unique email and password.
- **POST `/login`**: Authenticates an existing user and returns an access token.
- **GET `/protected`**: A sample protected route that requires authentication.

## Security Considerations

- **Password Encryption**: All passwords are securely hashed using bcrypt before storage.
- **JWT Authentication**: Secure tokens are used for authentication and session management.
- **Environment Variables**: Sensitive credentials are stored securely using dotenv.
- **Middleware Protection**: Routes requiring authentication are secured using middleware functions.
